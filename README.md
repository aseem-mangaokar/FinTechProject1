## How does state policy on Alcohol affect the consumption of Alcohol Products?

As the above summary statistics show, the standard deviations in taxes on all three types of alcohol products are greater than the standard deviations in consumption of the same alcohol products.

The summary statistics show that on average, people in the US consume most of their alcohol in the form of beer, with spirits closely following in average yearly consumption per capita and wine consumption less than half the corresponding consumption of spirits

Upon examination of the data visualizations provided (lmplots) , it is evident that the level of taxation on alcohol does not have a dramatic effect on the consumption of alcohol.

Understandably, in places such as Utah, where the average attitude towards drinking can be perceived as conservative, consumption of alcohol varies significantly more from the mean.

In almost every state, the 18-year period examined showed a gradual uptrend in per capita alcohol consumption, with consumption peaking for most states just before the most recent Recession born from the crash in the housing market. 

In the year following the housing market crash, as the unemployment rate rose across the United States, alcohol consumption decreased at a corresponding rate in most states. This can be attributed to lower levels of disposable income.

As the economy recovered, the implied increase in disposable income per capita is reflected in the decrease in the unemployment rate, and a corresponding increase in the number of alcoholic drinks per year, per capita, in most states.

NOTABLE OUTLIERS:
Arizona, Georgia and South Carolina have both been in a drinking downtrend and a personal income uptrend across the time period

In some states, such as Connecticut, Illinois and New York, alcohol consumption per capita did not decrease dramatically year-on-year, if at all, over the course of the same time span.
